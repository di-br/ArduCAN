# ArduCAN
**Ardu**ino **CAN**

This tries to sniff and log data on a CAN bus.

### General idea
1. Get some cheap Arduino hardware
2. Add CAN bus shield w/ uSD capability
3. Come up with a sketch that continuously reads and dumps to the SD card
4. Have a format that can be used to replay with canplayer
5. *End up with a much more lightweight and smaller unit to log the CAN bus*

All been done before, but that's not the point...

### Prerequisites
1. Some Arduino board. I use a SparkFun Redboard:
